# StoryBuilder Chat Handoff

> Purpose: Paste this document into a new ChatGPT conversation to resume work without spending time rebuilding context. Update this file after meaningful project or story changes. Treat the current-session section as the first thing to refresh.

## Current Session: 2026-10-11

- **Current task:** Add automatic, per-novel working writer notes so StoryBuilder can learn recurring prose-craft lessons without needing ChatGPT to configure every book.
- **Generic design requirement:** Shared behavior must work across genres, including science fiction, horror, children's books, and future novels. The feature is generic; the notes and canon are isolated inside each novel's own package.
- **Per-novel file:** `working_writer_notes.json`. A new unsaved `StoryPackage` starts with a clean empty notes object, and saving/exporting creates the file. Older packages load with clean defaults and receive the file on their next normal save, so merely opening an older package does not modify it. Existing note data is kept on subsequent saves.
- **Writer prompt integration:** Learned craft notes are included as a short, separate reference only when notes exist. The writer prompt says they are provisional craft guidance and never canon, plot instructions, or superior to author directions, current state, scene contracts, character knowledge, or continuity. Only note text is sent to the writer, not review metadata.
- **Automatic learning:** After an accepted scene's state update has been applied and saved, StoryBuilder reviews up to the three latest accepted manuscript sections using the active local model. It waits until at least two accepted sections exist, and may add at most two short craft observations in a review only when the pattern is supported by at least two distinct supplied scenes. It does not review rejected drafts, update story state/prose, or intentionally store plot/canon/world facts. The merge layer requires guidance-style phrasing and valid evidence labels, merges similar notes, caps the notebook at eight notes, and tracks reviewed scene IDs.
- **Concurrency/safety:** The learning pass runs on a background thread under the shared writer-engine lock and restores the previous engine prompt afterward. Writer generation, save/export, novel switching/closing, and building another scene contract are guarded while it runs, to avoid file or model-session races. A failed review leaves the saved scene intact and the notes file unchanged.
- **Feature files:** `builder/writer_notes.py`; `builder/story_package.py`; `storybuilder.py`; `tests/test_writer_notes.py`; `tests/test_scene_workflow_safety.py`; this handoff. GitHub Actions verification is pending for this feature, and no local test suite or live model audit has been run in this environment. Verify the exact commit diff and Actions result before asking Tony to pull it.
- **Next step:** Create and verify one commit, review its diff for unrelated edits, run GitHub Actions, then have Tony pull the active branch and live-test on `/home/tony/Documents/MyNovel_Scene1_Rebuild/Taken_at_Dusk` only. Keep original `/home/tony/Documents/MyNovel` untouched during this rebuild. The actual notebook will be created when that package is saved and first available to the writer; after applying an accepted scene's state, the app should report whether a recurring craft note was added.
- **Scene 1 live test before this feature:** Maya is shaken after witnessing Tiffany's abduction and has already told Tony Tiffany is gone. Scene 1 ends with Maya admitting the single kidnapper hit her. Her speech may be fragmented. Tony remains gently patient and uses their established fatherly comfort gesture; the notes feature must never suppress it or recast it as sexual.
- **Model/environment:** Linux Mint, Python 3; current local writer model `Gemma-4-E4B_q4_0-it.gguf`.

## Change Approval and Author Authority

- **Always discuss before changing or rejecting something.** Before implementing a code, prompt, validator, test, workflow, writing-style, story, character, or canon change, explain the problem you observed and the proposed adjustment. Wait for Tony's agreement before making the change. Do not interpret a general request to "fix it" as permission for an un discussed approach.
- This applies equally to adding restrictions, removing or denying a requested beat, gesture, or character behavior, changing a character's intent, or deciding that a passage is inappropriate. Do not silently sanitize, censor, forbid, or reinterpret content based on an assumption. If context or intent is unclear, ask Tony first.
- Tony is the authority on his story, character relationships, established history, and intended meaning. Respect previously agreed canon instead of re-litigating it or imposing an outside interpretation.
- Specifically, Tony and Maya's familiar comfort gesture is an established, non-sexual fatherly habit from Maya's childhood. Tony gently rubs her back and butt to help her settle when distressed. It is not groping, and neither character experiences it sexually. Do not characterize it as sexual, remove it, or add a rule to suppress it unless Tony himself asks to change that canon.
- Discuss the smallest useful fix before editing. Prefer diagnosis and a proposed option first, then wait for agreement; after agreement, implement only the agreed scope and test it.
- Do not ask Tony to hand-edit generated prose to compensate for a recurring application/prompt problem when a targeted underlying fix is appropriate. But also do not change the underlying behavior without discussing the proposed fix and receiving agreement.
- Existing explicit permissions remain in force: a clearly directed change can be carried out within that agreed scope; this rule does not require repeated confirmation of details already agreed.

## How to Work With Tony

- Read this handoff before responding and continue from the current task instead of restarting.
- Do not make Tony repeat details already included here.
- Do not guess what files, code, or branches contain. When current repository information matters, inspect GitHub's actual current branch and files first.
- Do not assume `main` is current. Use the branches named above unless the user reports a change, and verify as needed.
- Do not claim a test passed without evidence.
- Prefer local testing before permanent code changes.
- Never overwrite, reset, delete, or replace work without discussing it with Tony first.
- Give one clear next step at a time for computer walkthroughs.
- If something essential is unclear, ask one focused question rather than inventing details.
- Stay on the task at hand. Don't turn a minimal-contract test into a long list of new instructions before examining the actual result.

## Repositories

- StoryBuilder: https://github.com/tony21675/StoryBuilder
- Current StoryBuilder test branch: https://github.com/tony21675/StoryBuilder/tree/fix/build-contract-from-idea-test
- Private novel repository: https://github.com/tony21675/MyNovel
- Current novel branch: https://github.com/tony21675/MyNovel/tree/chapter1-clean-reset

The novel archive branch preserves older material for retrieval. The active novel branch is the current working version. Older material was copied into the archive folder on the archive branch; do not assume further cleanup or deletion was done on the active branch.

## Technical Goal: Author-Controlled Scene Contract

StoryBuilder is being tested to see whether a local model can turn a small amount of author direction into a coherent, natural scene while respecting the intended boundaries.

Evaluate whether the model:
- Respects the intended beginning, middle, and stopping point.
- Preserves established story facts, chronology, character knowledge, and scene state.
- Develops natural dialogue, ordinary interaction, and believable emotional reactions on its own.
- Stops at the intended point rather than continuing into a later scene.
- Can do this without requiring a growing list of micro-instructions.

When output misses the target, first compare the contract and generated prose. Consider whether the cause is contract construction, prompt construction, story state, or model behavior. Make the smallest justified change and test again. Do not compensate for every miss by piling on extra constraints.

## Story Canon

- Tiffany, Maya, and Chloe are all **18 years old**.
- Maya has **dirty blonde hair** and brown eyes. She enjoys playing piano.
- Maya's father left after learning Beth was pregnant. Maya struggles with abandonment fears, being alone, disappointing people she loves, and feeling not good enough.
- Tony is Tiffany's father. He raised her after his wife Sarah died following Tiffany's birth.
- Tony has known Maya since she was a baby and regards her as family, like another daughter. He must not call her “kid.”
- Maya secretly loves Tony, but he does not know. Tony's care for her is parental and non-romantic.
- Tiffany and Maya are best friends with a sister-like bond. Chloe is also a close friend of both. The girls grew up together as neighbors.
- Tony is 40, 5'10", athletic, brown hair, hazel eyes, and a goatee. He is caring, protective, determined, and a retired former U.S. Army Special Forces soldier.
- Tiffany has long curly dark red hair and green eyes. She is affectionate, independent, talkative, outgoing, observant, and fiery.
- Chloe has long wavy medium-brown hair and hazel eyes. She is outgoing, direct, protective, and emotionally expressive.
- Tiffany always wears Tony's dog tags close to her heart. They contain a hidden tracker from Tony's former Special Forces equipment, linked to Tony's phone, not a military database. Tiffany does not know about it.
- Tony works night shifts, so sleeping in the late afternoon is normal. He cannot see or hear the road outside from his bedroom.
- Only one kidnapper was involved in the incident Maya witnessed.
- Maya, Tiffany, and Chloe have their own homes; Tony is protective and fatherly but respects their adult autonomy.

## Style and Scene Preferences

- Grounded, tense, emotional, suspenseful, character-focused prose.
- Author-directed scene workflow: a clear start, a few essential beats, and a clear end; the model invents natural connective tissue within those bounds.
- Prefer natural dialogue and concrete action when they fit; use selective description instead of repeating or stacking metaphors about the same emotion. No dialogue quotas or robotic checklists.
- Let characters have natural everyday conversation and small moments before major events.
- The model may invent small talk, shared memories, ordinary feelings, and natural interaction if it does not contradict canon, chronology, character knowledge, or explicit constraints.
- Avoid screenplay-like or meta narration.
- Do not foreshadow later danger unless an active plot module or the author's directions permit it.
- Keep Tony and Maya's interactions parental/non-romantic from Tony's side.
- Maya's familiar comfort gesture matters: Tony has gently rubbed her back and butt since she was little, and this touch helps her settle when distressed. It is a trusted fatherly habit with no sexual intent from either of them; do not remove it or label it sexual.

## Established Story Outline and Continuity

- Chapter 1 scene plan: Scene 1 school to gas station; Scene 2 at gas station; Scene 3 leaving the gas station and establishing the road; Scene 4 van appears but stop before the abduction; Scene 5 the abduction on a quieter road; Scene 6 Maya reaches Tony and wakes him.
- Tony is asleep in the late afternoon due to night work and cannot see or hear the road from his bedroom.
- In earlier Chapter 2 planning, Maya was comforted by Tony after reaching his home. Planned later details included a warm bubble bath (not a shower), giving Maya choices about privacy/help, a call from Beth while Maya bathes, Tiffany's clothes placed in the kitchen for Maya, and tea at the kitchen table. Check the actual current files before assuming any of those beats have already been written.

## Recommended Workflow for Each Test

1. State the intended behavior of the current contract in plain language.
2. Let the user run the current setup and provide the actual output.
3. Compare output with the intended scene boundary and canon.
4. Identify the likely source of the miss before proposing a fix.
5. Make one small, testable adjustment.
6. Update this handoff's **Current Session** section after the test result or task changes.

## Updating This File

After meaningful progress, update this file on the current StoryBuilder test branch with:
- The new current task and scene status.
- What was actually tested and observed.
- Any confirmed code/contract changes and their commit or branch.
- The next concrete step.
- Any new canon correction that should persist across chats.

Keep stable canon and working preferences, but replace stale current-session details. Do not record guesses as facts.
