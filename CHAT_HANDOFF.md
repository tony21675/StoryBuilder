# StoryBuilder Chat Handoff

> Purpose: Paste this document into a new ChatGPT conversation to resume work without spending time rebuilding context. Update this file after meaningful project or story changes. Treat the current-session section as the first thing to refresh.

## Current Session: 2026-10-10

- **Current status:** Tony reviewed a fresh Chapter 2 Scene 1 generation. The opening positions were clearer and the scene hit its key beats, but the prose repeated Maya's distress, explained Tony's familiar comfort gesture several times, and described Tony as having “insisted” when he should be gently patient. Tony confirmed the target: give readers enough natural context to understand shared history, preserve creative freedom, and avoid repeating a feeling or its meaning.
- **Agreed prompt adjustment:** Rather than adding more rules, consolidate overlapping style guidance. Writer rule 9 now asks for one brief, natural cue when reader-unfamiliar shared history matters, then trusts the action and response without explaining it again. It also keeps character tone consistent, so gentle concern does not become pressure unless the scene calls for it. Duplicate comfort-gesture/style guidance was removed from the secondary generation prompt; the familiar fatherly gesture remains fully permitted and must not be suppressed or sexualized.
- **Source/test status:** The prompt and regression assertions are updated on branch `fix/build-contract-from-idea-test`. GitHub Actions run `38115758164` ran all 18 tests and failed only because an existing assertion expected the exact phrase “Avoid an incongruous relationship metaphor”; writer rule 24 now retains that established wording. The follow-up commit is awaiting CI. No local suite was run in this environment, and the new live prose behavior remains unverified.
- **Latest live scene result:** Tony's pasted generation had Tony sitting against the headboard with Maya curled against his chest, noticing the slap mark, comforting her with their familiar gesture, and ending with Maya admitting the kidnapper slapped her. The draft's acceptance status is unconfirmed. Do not treat the generated wording as canon or ask Tony to edit recurring prompt problems by hand.
- **Next step:** Verify the branch CI run. After checks pass, Tony can pull the branch, close StoryBuilder with **Close** (not Close & Sync), relaunch with `cd ~/Documents/StoryBuilder && python3 storybuilder.py`, open only `/home/tony/Documents/MyNovel_Scene1_Rebuild/Taken_at_Dusk`, and generate Scene 1 once to review. Keep original `/home/tony/Documents/MyNovel` untouched.
- **Current story boundary:** Scene 1 starts after Maya has already reached Tony's bedroom and told him Tiffany is gone. End Scene 1 when Maya admits she was hit. Scene 2 is for her account of the abduction. Exactly one kidnapper. Do not move later bath, Beth call, clothes, or tea into these scenes unless Tony directs it.
- **Confirmed prior tests:** Tony reported that all 18 tests passed locally for the prior prompt version. That result does not cover this newer consolidation. Earlier prompt/validator commits and their CI history remain documented in the repository history.
- **Environment/model:** Linux Mint, Python 3. The current writer model is `Gemma-4-E4B_q4_0-it.gguf`. The active rebuild package is separate from the original novel package.

## Change Approval and Author Authority

- **Always discuss before changing or rejecting something.** Before implementing a code, prompt, validator, test, workflow, writing-style, story, character, or canon change, explain the problem you observed and the proposed adjustment. Wait for Tony's agreement before making the change. Do not interpret a general request to "fix it" as permission for an un discussed approach.
- This applies equally to adding restrictions, removing or denying a requested beat, gesture, or character behavior, changing a character's intent, or deciding that a passage is inappropriate. Do not silently sanitize, censor, forbid, or reinterpret content based on an assumption. If context or intent is unclear, ask Tony first.
- Tony is the authority on his story, character relationships, established history, and intended meaning. Respect previously agreed canon instead of re-litigating it or imposing an outside interpretation.
- Specifically, Tony and Maya's familiar comfort gesture is an established, non-sexual fatherly habit from Maya's childhood. Tony gently rubs her back and butt to help her settle when distressed. It is not groping, and neither character experiences it sexually. Do not characterize it as sexual, remove it, or add a rule to suppress it unless Tony himself asks to change that canon.
- Discuss the smallest useful fix before editing. Prefer diagnosis and a proposed option first, then wait for agreement; after agreement, implement only the agreed scope and test it.
- Do not ask Tony to hand-edit generated prose to compensate for a recurring application/prompt problem when a targeted underlying fix is appropriate. But also do not change the underlying behavior without discussing the proposed fix and receiving agreement.
- Existing explicit permissions remain in force: a clearly directed change can be carried out within that agreed scope; this rule does not require repeated confirmation of details already agreed.

## How to Work With Tony

- Read this handoff before responding and continue from the current task instead of restarting.
- Do not make Tony repeat details already included here.
- Do not guess what files, code, or branches contain. When current repository information matters, inspect GitHub's actual current branch and files first.
- Do not assume `main` is current. Use the branches named above unless the user reports a change, and verify as needed.
- Do not claim a test passed without evidence.
- Prefer local testing before permanent code changes.
- Never overwrite, reset, delete, or replace work without discussing it with Tony first.
- Give one clear next step at a time for computer walkthroughs.
- If something essential is unclear, ask one focused question rather than inventing details.
- Stay on the task at hand. Don't turn a minimal-contract test into a long list of new instructions before examining the actual result.

## Technical Goal: Author-Controlled Scene Contract

StoryBuilder is being tested to see whether a local model can turn a small amount of author direction into a coherent, natural scene while respecting the intended boundaries.

Evaluate whether the model:
- Respects the intended beginning, middle, and stopping point.
- Preserves established story facts, chronology, character knowledge, and scene state.
- Develops natural dialogue, ordinary interaction, and believable emotional reactions on its own.
- Stops at the intended point rather than continuing into a later scene.
- Can do this without requiring a growing list of micro-instructions.

When output misses the target, first compare the contract and generated prose. Consider whether the cause is contract construction, prompt construction, story state, or model behavior. Make the smallest justified change and test again. Do not compensate for every miss by piling on extra constraints.

## Story Canon

- Tiffany, Maya, and Chloe are all **18 years old**.
- Maya has **dirty blonde hair** and brown eyes. She enjoys playing piano.
- Maya's father left after learning Beth was pregnant. Maya struggles with abandonment fears, being alone, disappointing people she loves, and feeling not good enough.
- Tony is Tiffany's father. He raised her after his wife Sarah died following Tiffany's birth.
- Tony has known Maya since she was a baby and regards her as family, like another daughter. He must not call her “kid.”
- Maya secretly loves Tony, but he does not know. Tony's care for her is parental and non-romantic.
- Tiffany and Maya are best friends with a sister-like bond. Chloe is also a close friend of both. The girls grew up together as neighbors.
- Tony is 40, 5'10", athletic, brown hair, hazel eyes, and a goatee. He is caring, protective, determined, and a retired former U.S. Army Special Forces soldier.
- Tiffany has long curly dark red hair and green eyes. She is affectionate, independent, talkative, outgoing, observant, and fiery.
- Chloe has long wavy medium-brown hair and hazel eyes. She is outgoing, direct, protective, and emotionally expressive.
- Tiffany always wears Tony's dog tags close to her heart. They contain a hidden tracker from Tony's former Special Forces equipment, linked to Tony's phone, not a military database. Tiffany does not know about it.
- Tony works night shifts, so sleeping in the late afternoon is normal. He cannot see or hear the road outside from his bedroom.
- Only one kidnapper was involved in the incident Maya witnessed.
- Maya, Tiffany, and Chloe have their own homes; Tony is protective and fatherly but respects their adult autonomy.

## Style and Scene Preferences

- Grounded, tense, emotional, suspenseful, character-focused prose.
- Author-directed scene workflow: a clear start, a few essential beats, and a clear end; the model invents natural connective tissue within those bounds.
- Prefer natural dialogue and concrete action when they fit; use selective description instead of repeating or stacking metaphors about the same emotion. No dialogue quotas or robotic checklists.
- Let characters have natural everyday conversation and small moments before major events.
- The model may invent small talk, shared memories, ordinary feelings, and natural interaction if it does not contradict canon, chronology, character knowledge, or explicit constraints.
- Avoid screenplay-like or meta narration.
- Do not foreshadow later danger unless an active plot module or the author's directions permit it.
- Keep Tony and Maya's interactions parental/non-romantic from Tony's side.
- Maya's familiar comfort gesture matters: Tony has gently rubbed her back and butt since she was little, and this touch helps her settle when distressed. It is a trusted fatherly habit with no sexual intent from either of them; do not remove it or label it sexual.

## Established Story Outline and Continuity

- Chapter 1 scene plan: Scene 1 school to gas station; Scene 2 at gas station; Scene 3 leaving the gas station and establishing the road; Scene 4 van appears but stop before the abduction; Scene 5 the abduction on a quieter road; Scene 6 Maya reaches Tony and wakes him.
- Tony is asleep in the late afternoon due to night work and cannot see or hear the road from his bedroom.
- In earlier Chapter 2 planning, Maya was comforted by Tony after reaching his home. Planned later details included a warm bubble bath (not a shower), giving Maya choices about privacy/help, a call from Beth while Maya bathes, Tiffany's clothes placed in the kitchen for Maya, and tea at the kitchen table. Check the actual current files before assuming any of those beats have already been written.

## Recommended Workflow for Each Test

1. State the intended behavior of the current contract in plain language.
2. Let the user run the current setup and provide the actual output.
3. Compare output with the intended scene boundary and canon.
4. Identify the likely source of the miss before proposing a fix.
5. Make one small, testable adjustment.
6. Update this handoff's **Current Session** section after the test result or task changes.

## Updating This File

After meaningful progress, update this file on the current StoryBuilder test branch with:
- The new current task and scene status.
- What was actually tested and observed.
- Any confirmed code/contract changes and their commit or branch.
- The next concrete step.
- Any new canon correction that should persist across chats.

Keep stable canon and working preferences, but replace stale current-session details. Do not record guesses as facts.
