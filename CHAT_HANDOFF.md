# StoryBuilder Chat Handoff

> Purpose: Paste this document into a new ChatGPT conversation to resume work without spending time rebuilding context. Update this file after meaningful project or story changes. Treat the current-session section as the first thing to refresh.

## Current Session: 2026-10-09

- Current StoryBuilder test branch: `fix/build-contract-from-idea-test` in `tony21675/StoryBuilder`.
- Current novel branch: `chapter1-clean-reset` in `tony21675/MyNovel`.
- The author has synced the laptop changes. The current novel state is Chapter 2, Scene 2; the updated `current_situation` is present in GitHub.
- Scene 2 has not yet been written. Its intended boundary remains: Tony comforts Maya, notices the slap mark, and Maya manages to tell him the kidnapper hit her while still shaken. She does not give the full abduction account until Scene 3.
- There was only ONE kidnapper in the incident Maya witnessed.
- The current situation and continuity-note cleanup were reflected in `current_state.json`. Updated the stale state status from `story_start` to `in_progress` and removed the obsolete `Chapter 1 begins here.` entry from the legacy `continuity_requirements` list. Existing continuity notes and story content were otherwise preserved. Commit: `f4eeb58f7fa8a36ede7b6a22de9ad37fcc78600e` on `chapter1-clean-reset`.
- Updated `storybuilder.py` on the StoryBuilder test branch to:
  - Automatically rebuild Writer direction after **Apply State Update** advances to the next scene.
  - Automatically rebuild Writer direction when the author applies manual Current State edits.
  - Automatically rebuild Writer direction when the author applies Current Situation edits.
  - Change state status from `story_start` to `in_progress` when the first accepted scene state update is applied, without overriding other custom status values.
  - Show a clear status message that the next chapter/scene direction has been refreshed.
  Commit: `1f30177fdf747ef2b43eae522e12a9a95cdf5c0b` on `fix/build-contract-from-idea-test`.
- The earlier author-controlled scene-contract improvements remain on this branch, including preserving explicit boundaries between a limited disclosure and a later full account, and keeping important requested actions visible in the contract.
- **Testing status:** these new code changes have been committed remotely but have not yet been locally run or verified. Do not claim they passed. After Tony pulls the updated StoryBuilder branch and the current novel branch, test a safe state edit first, then verify that applying an accepted scene state update advances the scene number and refreshes Writer direction without manually visiting Scene Contract.
- Expected workflow: write scene → save/accept → analyze accepted scene → apply state update → automatically advance and prepare the next scene direction. If the current chapter is complete, do not build a direction for a nonexistent next scene.
- Next scene boundaries: Scene 2 ends when Maya admits she was hit but remains shaken; Scene 3 contains her full account and ends with Maya still on the bed with Tony. Do not plan Scene 4 until Tony asks.

## How to Work With Tony

- Read this handoff before responding and continue from the current task instead of restarting.
- Do not make Tony repeat details already included here.
- Do not guess what files, code, or branches contain. When current repository information matters, inspect GitHub's actual current branch and files first.
- Do not assume `main` is current. Use the branches named above unless the user reports a change, and verify as needed.
- Do not claim a test passed without evidence.
- Prefer local testing before permanent code changes.
- Never overwrite, reset, delete, or replace work without discussing it with Tony first.
- Give one clear next step at a time for computer walkthroughs.
- If something essential is unclear, ask one focused question rather than inventing details.
- Stay on the task at hand. Don't turn a minimal-contract test into a long list of new instructions before examining the actual result.

## Repositories

- StoryBuilder: https://github.com/tony21675/StoryBuilder
- Current StoryBuilder test branch: https://github.com/tony21675/StoryBuilder/tree/fix/build-contract-from-idea-test
- Private novel repository: https://github.com/tony21675/MyNovel
- Current novel branch: https://github.com/tony21675/MyNovel/tree/chapter1-clean-reset
- Archive branch: https://github.com/tony21675/MyNovel/tree/archive/pre-cleanup-2026-10-08
- Legacy archived files: https://github.com/tony21675/MyNovel/tree/archive/pre-cleanup-2026-10-08/archive/legacy-from-main

The novel archive branch preserves older material for retrieval. The active novel branch is the current working version. Older material was copied into the archive folder on the archive branch; do not assume further cleanup or deletion was done on the active branch.

## Technical Goal: Author-Controlled Scene Contract

StoryBuilder is being tested to see whether a local model can turn a small amount of author direction into a coherent, natural scene while respecting the intended boundaries.

Evaluate whether the model:
- Respects the intended beginning, middle, and stopping point.
- Preserves established story facts, chronology, character knowledge, and scene state.
- Develops natural dialogue, ordinary interaction, and believable emotional reactions on its own.
- Stops at the intended point rather than continuing into a later scene.
- Can do this without requiring a growing list of micro-instructions.

When output misses the target, first compare the contract and generated prose. Consider whether the cause is contract construction, prompt construction, story state, or model behavior. Make the smallest justified change and test again. Do not compensate for every miss by piling on extra constraints.

## Story Canon

- Tiffany, Maya, and Chloe are all **18 years old**.
- Maya has **dirty blonde hair** and brown eyes. She enjoys playing piano.
- Maya's father left after learning Beth was pregnant. Maya struggles with abandonment fears, being alone, disappointing people she loves, and feeling not good enough.
- Tony is Tiffany's father. He raised her after his wife Sarah died following Tiffany's birth.
- Tony has known Maya since she was a baby and regards her as family, like another daughter. He must not call her “kid.”
- Maya secretly loves Tony, but he does not know. Tony's care for her is parental and non-romantic.
- Tiffany and Maya are best friends with a sister-like bond. Chloe is also a close friend of both. The girls grew up together as neighbors.
- Tony is 40, 5'10", athletic, brown hair, hazel eyes, and a goatee. He is caring, protective, determined, and a retired former U.S. Army Special Forces soldier.
- Tiffany has long curly dark red hair and green eyes. She is affectionate, independent, talkative, outgoing, observant, and fiery.
- Chloe has long wavy medium-brown hair and hazel eyes. She is outgoing, direct, protective, and emotionally expressive.
- Tiffany always wears Tony's dog tags close to her heart. They contain a hidden tracker from Tony's former Special Forces equipment, linked to Tony's phone, not a military database. Tiffany does not know about it.
- Tony works night shifts, so sleeping in the late afternoon is normal. He cannot see or hear the road outside from his bedroom.
- Only one kidnapper was involved in the incident Maya witnessed.
- Maya, Tiffany, and Chloe have their own homes; Tony is protective and fatherly but respects their adult autonomy.

## Style and Scene Preferences

- Grounded, tense, emotional, suspenseful, character-focused prose.
- Let characters have natural everyday conversation and small moments before major events.
- The model may invent small talk, shared memories, ordinary feelings, and natural interaction if it does not contradict canon, chronology, character knowledge, or explicit constraints.
- Avoid screenplay-like or meta narration.
- Do not foreshadow later danger unless an active plot module or the author's directions permit it.
- Keep Tony and Maya's interactions parental/non-romantic from Tony's side.

## Established Story Outline and Continuity

- Chapter 1 scene plan: Scene 1 school to gas station; Scene 2 at gas station; Scene 3 leaving the gas station and establishing the road; Scene 4 van appears but stop before the abduction; Scene 5 the abduction on a quieter road; Scene 6 Maya reaches Tony and wakes him.
- Tony is asleep in the late afternoon due to night work and cannot see or hear the road from his bedroom.
- In earlier Chapter 2 planning, Maya was comforted by Tony after reaching his home. Planned later details included a warm bubble bath (not a shower), giving Maya choices about privacy/help, a call from Beth while Maya bathes, Tiffany's clothes placed in the kitchen for Maya, and tea at the kitchen table. Check the actual current files before assuming any of those beats have already been written.

## Recommended Workflow for Each Test

1. State the intended behavior of the current contract in plain language.
2. Let the user run the current setup and provide the actual output.
3. Compare output with the intended scene boundary and canon.
4. Identify the likely source of the miss before proposing a fix.
5. Make one small, testable adjustment.
6. Update this handoff's **Current Session** section after the test result or task changes.

## Updating This File

After meaningful progress, update this file on the current StoryBuilder test branch with:
- The new current task and scene status.
- What was actually tested and observed.
- Any confirmed code/contract changes and their commit or branch.
- The next concrete step.
- Any new canon correction that should persist across chats.

Keep stable canon and working preferences, but replace stale current-session details. Do not record guesses as facts.
